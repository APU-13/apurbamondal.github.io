# Apurba Mondal — GitHub Pages Portfolio (Ready-to-upload)

This folder contains a simple, modern portfolio site built with plain HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.
You can upload these files to a GitHub repository named `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` to publish a personal website.

## Files included
- `index.html` — main webpage (edit text, links, projects)
- `style.css` — styling for the site
- `script.js` — smooth scroll + theme toggle
- `Resume_Apurba_Mondal.pdf` — your resume (downloadable from the site)
- `assets/` — optional images (place `profile.jpg` here if you want a profile photo)

## Quick guide (easiest — using GitHub web UI)
1. Create a free GitHub account at https://github.com and sign in.
2. Create a new repository and **name it exactly** `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username).
   - Make it Public.
3. Click **Add file → Upload files** and upload *all files* from this folder (or drag-and-drop the entire folder).
4. Commit the changes.
5. Visit `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` (replace with your username). The site should be live within a minute.

## Alternative: using Git locally (for learners)
1. Install Git and a code editor (VS Code recommended).
2. In terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io
   cd YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io
   # copy the files into this folder, then:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add portfolio site"
   git push
   ```
3. Visit `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`

## Editing content
- Edit `index.html` to change text, dates or project links.
- Add your profile photo to `assets/profile.jpg` and uncomment the `<img>` tag in `index.html`.
- Replace `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` in the header & contact with your real GitHub URL.

## Helpful tips
- Keep project links pointing to public URLs (Power BI, Tableau Public, GitHub repos).
- For any 404, ensure `index.html` is in the **root** of the repository (not inside a folder).
- If you want, open a new issue or reach out and I can help customize the text or colors.

Good luck — you now have everything needed to publish your portfolio!
